## Samples


This Action allows you to specify your JaCoCo Code Coverage XML Path, and then
generate a markdown report from the test results and then it attaches it
to the Workflow Run as a Check Run. You can even set threshold coverage percentage and fail the action.

Here's a quick example of how to use this action in your own GitHub Workflows.

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    
      # generates coverage-report.md and publishes as checkrun
      - name: JaCoCo Code Coverage Report
        id: jacoco_reporter
        uses: PavanMudigonda/jacoco-reporter@v3.0
        with:
          coverage_results_path: jacoco-report/test.xml
          coverage_report_name: Coverage
          coverage_report_title: JaCoCo
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          skip_check_run: false
          minimum_coverage: 80
          fail_below_threshold: false
          publish_only_summary: false
          
      # uploads the coverage-report.md artifact    
      - name: Upload Code Coverage Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: code-coverage-report-markdown
          path: */coverage-results.md 
          retention-days: 1  
```
